# Instructions on Docker Deployment

- App_Dockerfile must be in the same directory of the docker-compose.yml and of the spring-boot-admin folder
- docker-compose build
- docker-compose up -d db (Start first the DB otherwise the correct tables are not created on time)
- docker-compose up -d app (Start the app some seconds after the db, if the app crashes execute again the same command)


App_Dockerfile builds a container with jdk 8 and maven, compiles and produces the JAR file that will be ran (need for spring-boot-admin dir)
MySQL_Dockerfile creates a mysql container that on startup executes the content of dmc/dmc.sql (The image of this container has also been pushed on DockerHub)

The docker-compose.yml starts two services:
	- The mysql service by relying on it's image
        - The app service executed after having built the App_Dockerfile (This is because the app while it is built, needs to connect to the db service)
