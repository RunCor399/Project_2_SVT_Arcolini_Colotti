# Project_2_SVT_Arcolini_Colotti

## Project Description
In this project we took care of searching and studying some of the **CVE Vulnerabilities** that affect **open-source Java web applications** based on the **Spring Framework**.</br>
In particular we have focused on **searching Projects affected by Injection Vulnerabilities** and carried on our activities by analysing these projects using two different **static source code analysis tools** and producing **exploitation examples** that could easily be reproduced by deploying the applications.

</br>

## Repository Description
In this repository it is possible to find **5 different projects** affected by **6 different injection CVEs** that were thoroughly analysed and for which detailed reports were produced by us.
