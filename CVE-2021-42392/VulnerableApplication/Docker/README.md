# **Application Deployment Cheatsheet**

## **Deploy with Docker**

~~~
./start_vulnerable_application.sh
~~~

 This bash script will automatically invoke Docker for downloading the container image of the application (published in my own Docker Hub repository) and executing the downloaded image so that it exposes port 8080

</br></br>

## **Deploy with JAR file**

~~~
java -jar VulnerableApplication.jar
~~~
