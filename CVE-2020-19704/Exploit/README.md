# Exploitation Steps

The python exploit can be launched either with one or zero parameter, the latter if specified will define a payload for the XSS Injection.

Usage:

- **Default Payload**
~~~
python3 exploit.py
~~~

</br>

- **Custom Payload** (must be inserted between single quotes)
~~~
python3 exploit.py '"><script>alert("This is a custom payload")</script>'
~~~

</br>

If the script is using the default payload, it will also start an **HTTP Server on port 8888**, make sure it is available to prevent conflicts.
Additionally keys pressed by users will be stored in a file named **log_output.txt**
