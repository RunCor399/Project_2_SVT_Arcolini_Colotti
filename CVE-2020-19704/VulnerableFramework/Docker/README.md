# **Application Deployment Cheatsheet**

**Only one of the following alternatives** shall be chosen in order to successfully deploy the infrastructure. </br>
Every command must be executed from within **Docker** folder, **unless otherwise specified**.

</br>

## **Suggested Deployment**

Execute the bash script that will automatically use **Docker Compose** to launch the two infrastructure services:

~~~
./deploy_infrastructure.sh
~~~

</br>

## **Build Application on the run and deploy**
This second deployment technique is only advised if it is wanted to modify the docker image of the application. In this case **Docker Compose** is still used but this time instead of pulling the application container image from **Docker Hub**, the latter is built on the fly using **App_Dockerfile**.


Usage:
~~~
./build_and_deploy.sh
~~~

</br>


## **Run Application JAR, Deploy MySQL DBMS**

Mixed approach in which the **application is executed through its .jar file** and MySQL DBMS is deployed with **Docker Compose**.

It is crucial for this to work, that the **MySQL DBMS service is started before the application**.

Steps:

- **Deploy MySQL DBMS**

~~~
docker-compose up -d db
~~~

</br>

- **Execute Application jar file** 
</br>

Navigate to **.../VulnerableFramework/jar** directory and run the following command:

~~~
java -jar SpringBootAdmin.jar
~~~
